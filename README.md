This project analyzes Netflix content data to explore trends in movies and TV shows across genres, countries, and release years. The workflow includes data cleaning and analysis using Python (Pandas) and dashboard creation in Power BI.

 Data Cleaning & Exploration (Python)

Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Handled null entries and standardized key columns (like date, type, and country).

Performed basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand data distribution.

 Dashboard (Power BI)

Designed an interactive Netflix Dashboard to visualize:

Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows.

Genre trends and popular categories.

Content production by country and release year.

Ratings and duration analysis.
